<p>WYMeditor is a browser based <abbr title="What You See is What You Mean">WYSIWYM</abbr> editor written in JavaScript.</p>

<p>By separating content and presentation we’ve created an editor that is both easier to use than regular
<abbr title="What You See is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors and that makes sure you have full control of what your site looks like.</p>
<p>WYMeditor generates valid strict XHTML, is supported in all major browsers and can easily be integrated with any content management system. 
WYMeditor is actually already available on <a href="">over 40 different platforms</a>.</p>
