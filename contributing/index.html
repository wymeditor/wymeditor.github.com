<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can contribute to the WYMeditor project. You don't need to be a JavaScript-ninja-rockstar to so do.</p>

<h3>Support and Documentation</h3>
<p>When browsing through <a href="">the forum</a> if you think you can add something to the discussion then don't be afraid to do so. Or if you find something weird or unclear in the docs — fix it!</p>

<h3>Core Development</h3>
<p>Getting involved in the development is really easy:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Fork us on GitHub</li>
    <li>Make something awesome (like fixing a bug)</li>
    <li>Send a pull request. Done!</li>
</ol>
<p>If Git isn't your strong suit there are plenty of good resources around to help you get started.</p>

<h3>Plugin Development</h3>
  <p>This is even easier than Core development — do what you want, how you want it, publish it (preferably on GitHub) and then <a href="">add it to the wiki</a>. Celebrate!</p>
